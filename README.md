# CS501044 - Discrete Structures

## Introduction
This module introduces mathematical tools required in the study of computer science. Topics include:

 - List item
 - Logic and proof techniques: propositions, conditionals, quantifications.
 - Relations and Functions: Equivalence relations and partitions. Partially ordered sets. Well-Ordering Principle. Function equality. Boolean/identity/inverse functions. Bijection.
 - Mathematical formulation of data models (linear model, trees and graphs).
 - Counting and Combinatoric: Pigeonhole Principle. Inclusion-Exclusion Principle. Number of relations on a set, number of injections from one finite set to another, Diagonalisation proof: An infinite countable set has an uncountable power set; Algorithmic proof: An infinite set has a countably infinite subset. Subsets of countable sets are countable.
