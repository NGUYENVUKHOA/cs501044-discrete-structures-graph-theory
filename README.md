# CS501044 - Discrete Structures - Graph & Tree (Lab Section)

## Introduction
This program contains Java classes which implement some basic algorithms in Graph Theory:

 - Find number of connected components.
 - Depth-first search and Breadth-first search.
 - Euler circuits and Hamiltonian circuits.
 - Find shortest path - Dijsktra algorithm.

## IDE
I used IntelliJ IDEA 2016.2 to program this priject. You can clone it to your computer and continue working on it by using IntelliJ IDEA 2016.2, or you can convert it to other IDE (e.g., Eclipse, NetBean).
