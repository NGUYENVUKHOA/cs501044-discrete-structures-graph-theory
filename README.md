# CS501044 - Discrete Structures - Graph Theory (Lab Section)

## Introduction
This program contains Java classes which implement some basic algorithms in Graph Theory:

 - Find number of connected components.
 - Depth-first search and Breadth-first search.
 - Euler circuits and Hamiltonian circuits.
 - Find shortest path - Dijsktra algorithm.

## IDE
I used [IntelliJ IDEA 2016.2](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) to program this project. You can clone it to your computer and continue working on it by using [IntelliJ IDEA 2016.2](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/), or you can convert it to other IDE (e.g., Eclipse, NetBean).

## How-to Run This Project
It is very easy to run and test this project. Suppose you successfully clone it to your computer, and also import it to your prefer IDE. Now, in each package (except `edu.tdt.graph`) I implement a `Test.java` class, thus you can compile and run `main` method in it. Besides that, I include some test graph in `resources` directory.
